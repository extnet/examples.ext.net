                properties: Width and Height.</p><p>By default, AnchorLayout will calculate anchor
                measurements based on the size of the container itself. However, if Width and Height
                are specifed, the layout will use it as a virtual container for the purposes of
                calculating anchor measurements based on it instead, allowing the container to be sized
                independently of the anchoring logic if necessary.</p><p>The items added to an AnchorLayout
                can also supply an anchoring-specific config property of anchor which is a string
                containing two values: the horizontal anchor value and the vertical anchor value (for
                example, '100% 50%'). This value is what tells the layout how the item should be
                anchored to the container. The following types of anchor values are supported:
                Percentage: Any value between 1 and 100, expressed as a percentage.</p><p>The first anchor is
                the percentage width that the item should take up within the container, and the second
                is the percentage height. Example: '100% 50%' would render an item the complete width
                of the container and 1/2 its height.</p><p>If only one anchor value is supplied it is assumed
                to be the width value and the height will default to auto. Offsets: Any positive or
                negative integer value. The first anchor is the offset from the right edge of the
                container, and the second is the offset from the bottom edge. Example: '-50 -100' would
                render an item the complete width of the container minus 50 pixels and the complete
                height minus 100 pixels. If only one anchor value is supplied it is assumed to be the
                right offset value and the bottom offset will default to 0. Sides: Valid values are
                'right' (or 'r') and 'bottom' (or 'b').</p><p>Either the container must have a fixed size or
                an anchorSize config value defined at render time in order for these to have any
                effect. Anchor values can also be mixed as needed. For example, '-50 75%' would render
                the width offset from the container right edge by 50 pixels and 75% of the container's
                height.</p>";
